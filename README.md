# FootB-stats
A python web-scraping code to get football championship statistics

A python script which scraps data from wikipedia pages of European championship tournaments (Serie A, Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1) and gets some interesting statistics out of it. 

The code is written in python and relies on BeautifulSoup, Pandas and numpy.
